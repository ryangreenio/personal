## What is SEO?

SEO stands for search engine optimization and is a strategy used to help potential customers find your website, services and products online.

If you've ever used a search engine such as Google to browse the web, you'll know that there are millions of pages of search results. But how many of those pages are your customers going to look at?

For most people, it's typically the top 3 results which are clicked on. In fact, [less than 90%](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/)of users will not click anything lower than the third result they are shown. 

The percentage breakdown looks something like this:

| **Google search results position** | **% of users likely to click** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Ad Position 1                      | 2.1%                           |
| Ad Position 2                      | 1.6%                           |
| Ad Position 3                      | 1.4%                           |
| Ad Position 4                      | 1.2%                           |
| Search Position 1                  | 39.6%                          |
| Search Position 2                  | 18.4%                          |
| Search Position 3                  | 10.1%                          |
| Search Position 4                  | 7.6%                           |
| Search Position 5                  | 5.1%                           |
| Search Position 6                  | 4.7%                           |
| Search Position 7                  | 3.5%                           |
| Search Position 8                  | 2.9%                           |
| Search Position 9                  | 2.2%                           |
| Search Position 10 (if present)    | 2.1%                           |

This means that if a user cannot find your website on the first page of Google, you'll be practically non-existent and other competitor sites are likely winning customers and business over yours.

This is where SEO can help.

## Why do companies need SEO?

As of Jan 14, 2022, there are currently over [1.92 billion](https://firstsiteguide.com/how-many-websites/) websites online and claiming a top spot on the first page of Google. The landscape is becoming increasingly competitive.

Companies need to focus on SEO strategies if they want any chance of users finding them when entering search queries into Google.

One common misconception is that your company name or brand is easy to find when you search for it but it is important to remember that most new customers won't know who you are. Typically their search will be broader - like a problem question e.g. "best pizza places in my area". This is where you can really drive new business and conversions.

## What are keywords?

When customers search the internet they will type in a string of words and phrases that meet their search intentions. These search intentions (also known as search queries) contain ideas and topics that define the content they are looking for.

As a website owner, it's important that keywords match content on your webpage that are relevant to what people are searching for. This will give you a higher chance of new customers discovering you.

In SEO, keywords are ranked by difficulty based on how competitive they are. Keywords are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100; 0-15 are easier to compete for than keywords ranked 40+. New websites or existing ones just starting out with an SEO strategy should focus on lower difficulty keywords with high volumes of search traffic.

### Is SEO Important for Every Business?

Yes, most businesses with an online presence will require some form of SEO support to ensure they remain competitive and see steady traffic growth for their site.

Industries which particularly benefit from SEO include:

* Software as a service businesses
* Fintech
* Recruitment
* Ecommerce
* Hospitality and tourism

## Key benefits of SEO

The five key benefits of SEO include:

1. More potential customers to your website
2. Greater potential to convert leads to sales
3. Improved website performance
4. Improved user experience
5. Connect users to valuable content they are searching for

## What are the 5 important concepts of SEO?

The 5 important concepts of search engine optimisation are:

* Technical optimisation
* Link building
* Core web vitals
* E-A-T
* Content publishing

### 1. Technical optimisation

Technical SEO optimisation ensures your website can be understood by search engines through best web practices such as schema. It also ensures your site performs well and meets high standards set by Google Core Web Vitals.

### 2. Link building

Websites are scored based on their authority. Domain Rating (DR) and URL Rating (UR) are metrics used to score how trustworthy a website or page is.

DR looks at the quality and quantity of domains linking to your entire website compared to UR which looks at just an individual web page within your website.

The higher your score, the easier you'll find ranking for competitive keywords.

Let's take a look at an example:

![disney seo score](/static/img/unnamed.png "disney seo score")

Disney.com has a DR score of 89 and a homepage UR score of 87. This is an incredibly high score as Disney is a trustworthy website with many external websites linking to them. They have a better chance of ranking for the competitive search term "toy" compared to a smaller website like Artoyz.com whose DR score is 49 and UR score is 43.

![Artoyz.com seo score](/static/img/unnamed-3.png "Artoyz.com seo score")

If we remember back to the section on keywords, each keyword has a difficulty level to rank for. "Toys" for example has a difficulty score of 78 which is extremely difficult to rank for. Currently, smythtoys.com has the number 1 spot.

### 3. Core Web Vitals

Core web vitals are Google's answer to scoring your website performance based on real-world usage data.

Longer page load times have a severe effect on X (also known as bounce rates).

The three metrics you should take notice of are:

* LCP – Largest Contentful Paint
* CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift
* FID - First Input Delay

### 4. Content publishing

You might be wondering why businesses invest time and money into content publishing and what the return on investment (ROI) is in doing so.

Producing quality content that helps answer important questions and problems that your potential customers might be searching for is one way SEO strategy that can help drive new customers to your website.

### 5. E-A-T

E-A-T stands for expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness and is a concept created by Google in their[Google Quality Raters' Guideline](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf).

The principles of E-A-T should be applied to every website:

* Expertise: produce high-quality content from people with expertise and knowledge
* Authority: develop a reputation as the go-to source of information about a topic
* Trust: show who published the content, be transparent, cite references and have sufficient contact information.

## What is an example of effective SEO?

What does good SEO look like? You'll know if your strategy is working if you're seeing an increase in organic search traffic and seeing your content rank higher on result pages for meaningful keywords.

Here are some examples to look out for:

### Steady growth in organic traffic

Steady growth in organic traffic is a positive sign that your SEO strategy is working. This may be slow-paced at first, but if you continue to publish great content that targets the right keywords and adds value to your developer communities you'll begin to see growth.

### Featured snippets

A featured snippet is a short extract from a webpage that appears at the top of Google search results in order to quickly answer a user's question.

If you are within the top ten results of Google, you have an opportunity to optimise your content to improve your chances of getting the featured snippet position. This could be as simple as changing your headings so that they are in a question/answer format.

### \#1 - #3 rank for a difficult keyword term

If you rank between the first and third results on Google for a competitive keyword you're doing pretty well. No position is ever permanent and competitors will continue to compete for first place by optimising and improving their content to maximise value for the user.

### A steady increase in conversions

The ultimate goal is to see organic traffic convert into leads and conversions. You can track conversions using Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. Effective SEO should have a direct correlation between increases in traffic and increases in conversions. Whatever your ROI metric is, an increase in conversions is a sign you're doing SEO well.

## Is SEO difficult?

SEO has varying degrees of difficulty depending on your in-house skills and expertise.

Technical SEO can be the most challenging part of an SEO strategy to implement - particularly if you do not have web development skills.

Web developer skills are mostly needed for technical changes to your website's code (both front-end and back-end) to ensure optimal speed performance and SEO best practices.

Producing content can be time consuming, so it is typically outsourced to freelance writers which can add to the costs of a marketing budget.

### Should SEO be part of my marketing strategy?

SEO is one of the most underinvested and undervalued forms of marketing. It sits between

One reason, companies are hesitant to pay for SEO, is that results can typically take 3-6 months to see. It should therefore be looked at as a mid-long-term strategy to grow traffic and conversions.

It is a common misconception that websites do not need SEO. Often, companies invest money into a website being built but assume they will be able to be found on Google. This is not true.

In fact, the majority of marketing budgets should initially be spent in SEO (alongside digital advertising).

### How many hours does SEO take?

For a standard website, you can expect the following hours required to complete each task:

| **SEO Task**                   | **Hours Needed**        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Technical SEO                  | 10-20 hours             |
| Competitor search analysis     | 20-30 hours per quarter |
| Keyword research               | 10 hours per month      |
| Content writing and publishing | 20-30 hours per month   |
| Link building                  | 20 hours per month      |
| Analytics and reporting        | 5 hours per month       |



Another misconception in SEO is that once you've built a website and optimised it for SEO, your work is done. SEO is something you continually need to work on and invest time into to ensure your traffic continually grows month on month.

## In-house SEO Vs Agency Vs Freelance

You might be considering learning SEO or employing someone to do it for you. Choosing the best option can be tricky to navigate.

Digital marketing agencies tend to be better if you're looking for an all-in-one package; for example if you need someone to design and build a website, produce branding and graphics and outsource the entire marketing process.

Long-term this is costly and you might find you're not the only client agency has, so time will be split between your project and others.

Hiring people in-house or learning it yourself is another option. This could be quite a time consuming process although it can be significantly less expensive than an agency.

Freelancers tend to work on a day rate and although they can be more expensive per day, they work fewer days than a full-time SEO team would and can deliver objective based projects.
