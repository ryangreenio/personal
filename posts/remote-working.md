Remote working is becoming a trend these days - the number of people who work from home has increased by 140% since 2005.

It's not just because it saves time and money but also offers many benefits to an employee including flexibility, autonomy, and freedom from office politics.

It is true that remote work comes with its own set of challenges such as isolation, lack of socialization, and sometimes difficulties in communication. But there are also many benefits that make up for them - as you will see in this article!

## 1. Flexibility

Working remotely offers the flexibility of choosing one's own work hours. Providing your company has a flexible-working policy you'll find that you can comfortably fit your work hours in with the optimal times you feel most productive or tailor it to meet your scheduling needs!

This is perfect for people who have families, people with demanding jobs, or people who just want to be their own boss and set their own schedule.

Many companies that are fully remote and have global employees allow for even more flexibility - allowing you to be anywhere in the world, working across different time zones.

## 2. Less Stress

Remote working can help reduce stress levels by providing a less demanding work environment, which in turn can lead to better health and well-being.

In fact, [86% of people](https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/remote-work-statistics/) feel that working remotely reduces stress - it allows for a better diet, more exercise, and a generally healthier lifestyle.

Gone are the wardrobe worries, freedom from office politics or that terrible commute to work.

Who needs a Google nap pod, when your office can be your bed and meditation sanctuary.

## 3. Increased Productivity

Productivity is a large part of the benefits many employees notice when they go remote.

[One study](https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/) showed that 77% of remote workers showed increased productivity, with 30% doing more work in less time and 24% doing more work in the same period.

Being able to focus on an individual task without being distracted by office chatter or other factors that may take away from productivity is one way in which productivity is increased.

## 4. A Better Work-Life Balance

Working remotely provides a more balanced work-life ratio, which in turn leads to increased personal satisfaction and happiness.

Creating a harmonious balance by integrating your work into a lifestyle that suits your needs, is crucial not only for improving your physical, emotional, and psychological well-being but is also essential to your career.

Happy workers who feel fulfilled and not overworked is a great goal most companies strive for.

## 5. Set your own schedule

You get to be your own boss when you work remote and set your own schedule as you see fit. You can also travel the world while still getting your work done providing your employer supports this.

Prioritise tasks as you see fit and plan your days accordingly.

## 6. Less illness

Being exposed to fewer people reduces your chances of catching an illness from others (particular in colder months). By reducing the risk of illness you are empowering yourself to be more productive and more healthy.

## 7. No commute

No commute means no traffic jams and no wasting time in traffic every day when you could be working or spending time with family members or friends instead of sitting in a car or on public transport.

It also saves on the cost of fuel and car maintenance as well as the cost of public transport fares which can add up over time.

## 8. Work from anywhere

Remote work is more than just an option for people in different time zones. The digital nomad is a term coined to describe a person who travels and works.

It offers a number of benefits, including the ability to work from anywhere, anytime. Working anywhere allows people to travel, explore new cultures and experience new things.

It can be a great way to learn about different cultures and languages.

## 9. There is no dress code; wear what you want!

Waking up in your PJs and working from bed on a winter's day is very appealing. Gone are the stresses of deciding what to wear and looking your smartest for work.

Comfort over appearances is definitely a big win. Just remember to brush your hair before you go on camera!

## 10. You can spend more time with your family, kids or dogs.

Whether it's spending more time with your pets, family or kids - remote work gives you more time to spend with whom you care about the most.

There is nothing quite like finishing a stressful meeting and having 3 retrievers to burden the load!
