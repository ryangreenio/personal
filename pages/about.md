### TL;DRs
- 5+ years in marketing 
- Loves SEO, data & analytics 
- Open to new opportunities


I’m Ryan - SEO’er by day, traveller by any free time I get. 

For the past 3 years I’ve worked remotely for some awesome companies including Picked, eSynergy Solutions, and most recently Reliably. 

When I am not working, I am planning my next travel adventure with my wife. You’ll often find us disagreeing on how many golden retrievers is too many to own.
