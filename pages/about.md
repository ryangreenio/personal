I’m Ryan - SEO’er by day, traveller by any free time I get. 

For the past 3 years I’ve worked remotely for some awesome companies including Picked, eSynergy Solutions, and most recently Reliably. 

When I am not working, I am planning my next travel adventure with my wife. You’ll often find us disagreeing on how many retrievers is too many to own. 

3 of the coolest things I’ve ever done: jumped out of an aeroplane; worked in New Zealand for 16 months and 3D printed a robot that could tell you my resume.
